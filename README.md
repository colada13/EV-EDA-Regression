## EV-EDA-Regression


This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and regression modeling on electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover insights and predict key metrics.

#Project Overview
The primary objectives of this project are:

Data Exploration: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns among various features.

Data Visualization: Create visual representations to illustrate findings and trends within the data.

Regression Modeling: Develop regression models to predict specific outcomes based on the available data.

#Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes various attributes related to electric vehicles, such as:

Vehicle Specifications: Details like make, model, year, battery capacity, range, etc.

Performance Metrics: Information on acceleration, top speed, efficiency, etc.

Market Data: Pricing, sales figures, and other relevant economic indicators.

Note: Ensure to include proper citations and links to the dataset if it's publicly available.

#Analysis and Findings
The analysis is structured as follows:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive statistics to summarize the data.
Correlation analysis to identify relationships between variables.
Visualization of distributions and trends.
Regression Modeling:

Building and evaluating regression models to predict target variables.
Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
Results
#Key findings from the analysis include:

Insights: Summarize the main insights gained from the EDA.
