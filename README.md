# EV Data EDA and Regression

## Project Overview

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and regression modeling on electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover insights and predict key metrics.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset to understand the distribution, relationships, and patterns among various features.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visual representations to illustrate findings and trends within the data.
- **Regression Modeling**: Develop regression models to predict specific outcomes based on the available data.

## Dataset

The dataset includes various attributes related to electric vehicles, such as:

- **Vehicle Specifications**: Details like make, model, year, battery capacity, range, etc.
- **Performance Metrics**: Information on acceleration, top speed, efficiency, etc.
- **Market Data**: Pricing, sales figures, and other relevant economic indicators.

*Note*: Ensure to include proper citations and links to the dataset if it's publicly available.

## Analysis and Findings

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the data.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between variables.
- **Visualization**: Visualize distributions and trends.

### 3. Regression Modeling
- Building and evaluating regression models to predict target variables.
- Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Results

Key findings from the analysis include:

- **Insights**: Summarize the main insights gained from the EDA.
- **Model Performance**: Overview of how well the regression models performed.

*Note*: Include specific results, figures, or tables as necessary to highlight important outcomes.

## Conclusion

Summarize the overall conclusions drawn from the project, including any recommendations or implications based on the findings.

## Future Work

- **Data Enhancement**: Collect additional data or features to improve analysis.
- **Model Refinement**: Explore advanced modeling techniques to enhance predictive performance.
